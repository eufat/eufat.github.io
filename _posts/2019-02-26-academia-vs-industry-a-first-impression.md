title: "Academia vs Industry: A Biased First Impression"
---

I currently work on both academia as a student that view how lecturer/researcher work and industry where I work part-time in a startup as an engineer with relatively small team. In my opinion currently , the industry has better offerings than academia in many ways.

Academia
- Evaluation driven work (ex: paper reviews, examination etc)
- Too much bullshit on paper formattings, forms etc
- No financial freedom, since money is a limited alms from institutions
- Lower motivation, since the resources are not fluctuating
- The ego of staff is high since they have full ownership of their work
- Your work is distant in term impact and time to society


Industry
- Economy driven work (ex: market fitness, client feedback etc)
- No bullshit, deliver value first and fast to client
- Usually more financial freedom, dependent on company fitness to the market
- Higher motivation, since the resources fluctuating rapidly
- Staff coordinate together to create the best product to keep up
- Your work is very close in term impact and time to society
