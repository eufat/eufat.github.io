title: Early Retirement and Investment

## Early Notes

In this post I gonna talk about the possibility of some strategy that you can try, but I am not asssuring that the strategy is going to work. This post may be changing overtime, along with the journey I going to experience and knowledge I gather. This post also more specific to people who live in Indonesia. I know too that by talking about money, I rise anxiety which lead to stingy attitude and insecurity, so please don't be.

## Background

Maybe a bit too early to talk about this and a bit controversial to talk about money, because no one wants to talk about it. Since almost everybody bad about it, including me too. Financial independence is when your assets sufficient enough to produce income for basic needs and more importantly, freedom.

Why retire so early? We do want to have some financial safety net right? so that we would not depend and not taking advantage of friends and relatives, not depending on our boss, and lastly so we can give more to society. Retiring is also mean you can choose whatever you want to do in life, not steered by money.

## Strategy

The strategy is by creating some large pile of assets that will give you enough cash each year to live with basic needs. That investment
is also going to grow overtime that equal to inflation that a country your living has.

### 1. Pile the Stack

Invest as much as possible with a percentage that will not ruin your own basic needs. To calculate the pile of investment you, I made up a formula to calculate the total assets.

![total-assets-formula](https://eufat.github.io/images/investment-1.png)

For example, in Indonesia where the [2017 inflation rate at 3.8%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?end=2017&locations=ID&start=1960&view=chart) and a each year you need 60 million IDR with 4% taken each year, then this is the pile you need.

To calculate the adjusted income of investment you will receive is

After we achieve that number we can say that ourselves is wealthy is good for retirement. With that number, it means that you also need an investment that grows as much as percentage of investment taken plus the inflation percentage (4%+3.8%) that equals to 7.8%. 

I think when we talk about investment there is a broad choiches that we can choose (P2P lending, real estate, deposits etc) but consider to choose the one with less hassle, reliable, affordable to start, which is [mutual funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund). This is some points that I have researched along the way.

1. Use mutual funds platform. Consider [tanamduit](https://www.tanamduit.com), [bareksa](https://www.bareksa.com/) or [SPOR](https://spor.sucorinvestam.com/id/)) to easily do a subscription or redemption on your assets.
2. Pick only the one licensed to financial services authority (It is called [OJK](https://www.ojk.go.id/Default.aspx) in Indonesia).
3. For long term investment pick stocks or mixed mutual funds. Consider [Sucorinvest AM](http://sucorinvestam.com/) and [Sinarmas AM](http://www.sinarmas-am.co.id/) since they have great profit and risk ratio.
4. Use mutual fund simulation and investment calculator to predict your future in a given timespan. Consider to use [this](https://www.bareksa.com/id/mutualfund/simulation) to simulate certain product and use [this] calculator to calculate investment.
5. After you buy the product, forget it. Do not watch too closely and only [rebalance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp) every year (There is a product called [Ajaib](https://www.ajaib.co.id/) is coming, it do the rebalancing automatically or as known as Robo-Investing like [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/) in US).
6. Choose sharia products if you believe in [the law](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia).

### 2. Consume Less and Produce More

In the world where we rushing to consume more not giving more, it also creates a hippo trouble in our life. You must know what is a border on essential needs. Our desire usually lead to quickest solution, not the wisest one. Consider to avoid that gospel of blinky lifestyle that will burden you and your environment in long term. If you want some real change, try to ditch social media to avoid the gospel and interact with real people in real life.

While producing more mean is instead of using software for example, try to create one. Instead of listening to music, try to compose one. Instead of hiring a handyman to build an sofa, try to build by yourself. Instead to learn from lectures, try to create your own curriculum. There's a lot of this world that we can do if we has effort to do so.

I've never been like filthy rich consumer, but I think movies like [Scarface](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/), [American Psycho](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/), [The Family Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218967/) and [Wall Street](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/) could teach you something.

### 3. Pick Side Projects

You can create your own project or pick from contest. By doing a project not only you will receive money but also you can gain your overall skill and widen your perspective about something you care about. Also same as in point one, I do have some point to note when picking projects

1. Avoid project that take a long term maintenance.
2. Write and sign MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) before work on the project, even it is from your closest relative.
3. In some other time try to pick a project with different technique.
4. Avoid project that has a relatively small impact (this based on your scale of experience).
5. Compare the compensation with the other project that has similiar specification.

### 4. Work in Foreign Country

If you good in foreign language, it's not wrong to start a working in foreign country for a while, or the other alternative is doing a remote work. Even in that foreign country got a significant jump in life expenses, usually the amount of money that you can save is also considerably higher than your current living country. For example in [this chart](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=ID-US-SG-AU-NZ-SE-NO-MY), we can compare the amount of average salary by putting the GDP per capita data.

![gdp-per-capita-comparison](https://eufat.github.io/images/gdp-comparison.png)

You could also consider to watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9UmdY0E8hU) about Nordic social democracies countries like Norway and Sweden that have several advantages over other countries to build wealth.

### 5. Build Your Own Company

This is the fastest but riskiest way to create wealth, so if you're young has an innovative idea that fit with the market you can start a company. By doing this way, don't forget to manage the share of the equity between you partners.

## Ending Notes
It is you that own yourself and you that give a direction to your own self, this is just the possibilities of way to create wealth and maintain it through investments. For me, I do have some plan for early retirement maybe in 30s to 40s, I believe that I will get there someday. Even if I too in love to work instead and want to continue working, I believe financial independence is a great assurance.
