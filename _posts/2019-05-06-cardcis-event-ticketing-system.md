title: "Cardcis: Event Ticketing System"
---

### Overview

The project is called Cardcis (from "Karcis" word in Indonesia). I've been doing this for a while to sharpen my Javascript skill, I think it will be useful for a lot of events too. This open-source project was actually based on the events held at my campus. It will be open sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/eufat/cardcis) in the late of this year. The features are this:

### Feature for User
1. Registration
2. Payment
3. Event Enrollment
4. Event Card

### Feature for Admin
1. Monitoring Statistics
2. Manage Registrations
3. Manage Payments
4. Manage Events
5. Event Card Scanner

### Technical Features
1. Serverless (Firebase and GCF)
2. React and Redux for view and state management
3. Firebase Auth for authentication
4. Firebase Firestore and Real-time database
5. Xendit and Stripe for payments
6. Algolia for Search
7. Material UI

### Closing Notes

If you actually have an event and doesn't wanna bother of complex ticketing system you can build with your own ticketing system with Cardcis. I will also create the paid version of it which only cost very little on every ticket payment. More details on [here](/docs/cardcis.pdf).
