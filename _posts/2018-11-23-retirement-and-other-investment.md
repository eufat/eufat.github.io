## Background

Maybe a bit too early to talk about this and a bit controversial to talk about money, because no one wants to talk about it. Since almost everybody bad about it, including me too. I do have some plan for early retirement maybe in 40s or 30s or if I [too in love about work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boYq2QwNbJE), I just want a financial independence at that time. Financial independence is when your money works harder for you, it provides you with basic needs and more importantly, [freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zAMlAq2u2Y).

Why retire so early? according to [him](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) every morning you wake up in a world where you got this financial independence, it's like having butterfly flying around your head, no pressure whatsoever. We do want to have some financial safety net right? so that we would not depend and not taking advantage of friends and relatives so we can give more. Retiring is also mean you can choose whatever you want to do in life, not steered by money.

## Early Notes

In this post I gonna talk about the possibility of some strategy that you can try, but I am not asssuring that the strategy is going to work. This post may be changing overtime, along with the journey I going to experience and knowledge I gather. This post also more specific to people who live in Indonesia. I know too that by talking about money, I rise anxiety which lead to stingy attitude and insecurity, so please don't be.

## Strategies

The strategy is by creating some large pile of investment that will give you enough cash each year to live with basic needs. That investment
is also going to grow overtime that equal to inflation that a country your living got.

### 1. Pile the Stack
Invest as much as possible with a percentage that will not ruin your own basic needs. To calculate the pile of investment you, I made up a formula to calculate what you need.

![investment-pile-formula](https://eufat.github.io/images/investment-1.png)

For example, in Indonesia where the [2017 inflation rate at 3.8%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?end=2017&locations=ID&start=1960&view=chart) and a each year you need 60 million IDR with 4% taken each year, then this is the pile you need.

After we achieve that number we can say that ourselves is wealthy is good for retirement. With that number, it means that you also need an investment that grows as much as percentage of investment taken plus the inflation percentage (4%+3.8%) that equals to 7.8%. 

I think when we talk about investment there is a broad choiches that we can choose (P2P lending, real estate, deposits etc) but consider to choose the one with less hassle, reliable, affordable to start, which is [mutual funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund). This is some points that I have researched along the way.

1. Use mutual funds platform. Consider [tanamduit](https://www.tanamduit.com), [bareksa](https://www.bareksa.com/) or [SPOR](https://spor.sucorinvestam.com/id/)) to easily do a redemption with your investment.
2. Pick only the one licensed to financial services authority (It is called [OJK](https://www.ojk.go.id/Default.aspx) in Indonesia).
3. For long term investment pick stocks or mixed mutual funds. Consider [Sucorinvest AM](http://sucorinvestam.com/) and [Sinarmas AM](http://www.sinarmas-am.co.id/)).
4. Use mutual fund simulation to predict your income with certain product. Consider to use [this](https://www.bareksa.com/id/mutualfund/simulation)).
5. After you buy the product, forget it. Do not watch too closely and only [rebalance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp) every year (There is a good product called [Ajaib](https://www.ajaib.co.id/) that do rebalancing automatically using some kind of algorithm, but at the time of writing the product is still work in progress).
6. Choose sharia products if you believe in [the law](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia).

### 2. Consume Less
In the world where we rushing to consume more not giving more, it also creates a hippo trouble in our life.

### 3. Pick Side Projects

### 4. Work in Foreign Country

### 5. Build Your Own Empire

### 6. Ditch Social Media
