I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Nodeflux](http://nodeflux.io) and organizing [Cloud Native Indonesia](https://github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups).

I am interested in both
designing and developing cloud application, computer vision and AI products. I've created both hardware and software products for the sake of fun and making money at the same time.

If you interested in experience and contact details, please consider viewing my résumé [here](/docs/resume.pdf).
