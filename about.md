 I study physics at University of Indonesia and currently working on several web development and data science projects. I am also a RnD guy at UI robotics team. View my resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v2QEILcYgqYaE_yI4qGiBH8DPppA4X49Wn-j50j6TOo/edit?usp=sharing). 

 This are random stuff what I do mostly

- Listening to indie/folk/alternative bands like Fleet Foxes and Bombay Bicycle Club
- Drawing with tintin like cartoon style
- Creating web apps with Javascript, React and Redux
- Randomly walking around campus
- Teaching orphans and cousins
- Reading Arstechnica and The Verge
- Eating various type of kwetiau
- Completely lost in data science and machine learning

 If you have any kind of project you want to talk about, which you think relevant with my background, please contact me at [@eufat](https://www.twitter.com/eufat)
