I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Nodeflux](http://nodeflux.io) and also one of the organizers at [Cloud Native Indonesia](https://github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups). I am interested in both
**designing and developing modern web, computer vision and AI** products. I've created both hardware and software products for the sake of fun and making money at the same time.

I live in Indonesia, in spare time, I do love cycling, writing and tinkering. I believe in **making value**
with the help of sophisticated tools **to move human being and nature forward**.

If you interested in experience and contact details, please consider viewing my résumé [here](/docs/resume.pdf).
