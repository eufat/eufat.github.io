I am a student at Universitas Indonesia and currently working on several projects. I am interested in both designing and building modern web, computer vision and artificial intelligence products. 

For more details, view my résumé [here](/docs/resume.pdf).

If you have an interesting project you want to talk about, which you think relevant with my background, don't hestitate to contact me through [email](mailto:eutsat@gmail.com).

À la prochaine,

Eufrat Tsaqib
